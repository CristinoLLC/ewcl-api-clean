# Railway PDB Model Fix

## üö® **Current Issue**

The PDB model is failing on Railway because:
1. **Model file is empty** (0.00 MB) - not being copied properly
2. **Cloudpickle not installed** - missing dependency
3. **Joblib version mismatch** - Railway has 1.3.2, we need 1.4.2

## ‚úÖ **Local Status**

The model works perfectly locally:
- ‚úÖ Model file exists: `models/pdb/ewclv1p3.pkl` (3.66 MB)
- ‚úÖ Model loads successfully with joblib
- ‚úÖ All 302 features available
- ‚úÖ LightGBM classifier working

## üîß **Railway Fixes Needed**

### 1. **Force Railway Rebuild**

The current deployment needs to be completely rebuilt. Railway should automatically rebuild when we push changes, but let's ensure it happens:

```bash
# Trigger rebuild
echo "Railway rebuild trigger $(date)" > railway_rebuild_trigger.txt
git add railway_rebuild_trigger.txt
git commit -m "trigger: force Railway rebuild with updated requirements"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Verify Model Files in Docker**

The Dockerfile should copy model files correctly:

```dockerfile
# Create model directory and copy entire tree for robustness
RUN mkdir -p /app/models
COPY models/ /app/models/
# List copied model artifacts for debugging
RUN find /app/models -maxdepth 3 -type f -printf "%P\n" | sort
```

### 3. **Check Railway Environment Variables**

Ensure these are set in Railway:
```bash
EWCLV1_P3_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/pdb/ewclv1p3.pkl
```

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

### 1. **Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl -s https://ewcl-api-production.up.railway.app/ewcl/analyze-pdb/ewclv1-p3/health | jq .
```

Expected after fix:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "model_name": "ewclv1p3",
  "loaded": true,
  "features": 302
}
```

### 2. **Test PDB Analysis**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ewcl-api-production.up.railway.app/ewcl/analyze-pdb/ewclv1-p3 \
  -F "file=@1CRN.pdb"
```

## üîç **Debugging Information**

### Current Railway Error:
```
File size: 0.00 MB
File hash: sha256:4e18e104433c918e23b6e538ff3c07c73db88478ccb04aa03fcc66dd6f28e8af
Python: 3.12.11
sklearn: 1.3.2
joblib: 1.3.2
numpy: 1.26.4
```

### Expected After Fix:
```
File size: 3.66 MB
File hash: sha256:d7d4ebba753ae64069d2c3416a1a55438db5f9739fda02dce61e8715b033ab38
Python: 3.12.11
sklearn: 1.7.0
joblib: 1.4.2
numpy: 1.26.4
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Wait for Railway rebuild** (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. **Test health endpoint** to verify model loading
3. **Test PDB analysis** with sample file
4. **Check Railway logs** if issues persist

## üìä **Expected Timeline**

- **Rebuild time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Model loading**: Should work immediately after rebuild
- **Frontend integration**: Ready once model loads

The PDB analysis should be fully functional once Railway completes the rebuild with the updated requirements and model files! üß¨‚ú®
