# Railway Deployment Guide for EWCL API

## üöÑ Railway Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Preparation
Your repository is already Railway-ready with:
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` (Railway will use this by default)
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` (fallback option)
- ‚úÖ `railway.json` (Railway configuration)
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your repo to GitHub (already done)
2. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
3. Create new project ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `ewcl-api-clean` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile and deploy

#### Option B: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 3. Environment Variables
In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Variables tab, add:

```
MAX_BODY_BYTES=100000000
EWCLV1_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/disorder/ewclv1.pkl
EWCLV1_M_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/disorder/ewclv1-M.pkl
EWCLV1_P3_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/pdb/ewclv1p3.pkl
EWCLV1_C_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/clinvar/ewclv1-C.pkl
EWCLV1_C_FEATURES_PATH=/app/models/clinvar/EWCLv1-C_features.json
ENABLE_RAW_ROUTERS=0
```

### 4. Test Deployment
Once deployed, test with:
```bash
# Health check
curl -s https://your-app.up.railway.app/healthz

# Models endpoint
curl -s https://your-app.up.railway.app/models | jq

# Sample prediction
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/ewclv1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @samples/sample_payload_ewclv1.json
```

### 5. Domain & SSL
Railway automatically provides:
- HTTPS endpoint: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
- Custom domain support (if needed)
- SSL certificates (automatic)

## üîÑ Dual Deployment Strategy

You can run both Fly.io and Railway simultaneously:

### Current Fly.io (Production)
- URL: `https://ewcl-api-clean.fly.dev`
- 8 machines across 4 regions
- Singleton model loading

### New Railway (Testing)
- URL: `https://ewcl-api-clean.up.railway.app`
- Automatic scaling
- Same codebase, faster deployments

## üìä Performance Comparison

Test both platforms with your workloads:
- **Deployment Speed**: Railway typically faster
- **Cold Start**: Railway often better
- **Global Edge**: Fly.io has more regions
- **Cost**: Compare pricing for your usage

## üöÄ Migration Path

1. Deploy to Railway (parallel to Fly.io)
2. Test API performance and reliability
3. Update Colab notebooks to use Railway URL
4. If satisfied, scale down or remove Fly.io deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure all model files are in Git LFS
- Verify Dockerfile compatibility

### Runtime Issues
- Check Railway service logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test model loading at startup

### Performance Issues
- Monitor Railway metrics
- Compare response times with Fly.io
- Check memory usage and scaling
